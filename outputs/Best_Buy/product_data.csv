The LG Direct Drive Motor delivers more power, quiet operation and greater efficiency than belt-driven motors—no belts, no pulleys, no worries. TurboDrum and 6Motion technologies provide a complete but gentler clean so clothes are always well-cared-for. And with ultra large capacity, you can fit more in every load to power through laundry day in less time. 
4.3 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Bring on your big loads of towels or jeans—this ultra large washer fits more in every load to save time., 
TurboDrum Technology: TurboDrum Technology simulates the agitator effect of traditional top load washers. The LG Direct Drive Motor rotates independently from the tub mechanism, so they spin in different directions to create a powerful water flow, for a complete but gentler clean., 
6Motion Technology: Based on the cycle you select, LG 6Motion technology uses up to 6 different wash motions, each designed to get clothes cleaner and help them last longer. Options range from a scrubbing PowerMotion that helps to dissolve stains to the gentle Swinging motion that’s ideal for delicates., 
SmartDiagnosis: If you ever experience an issue with your LG washer or dryer, you don't have to worry. The SmartDiagnosis feature helps the service center diagnose problems over the phone, or with a simple app on your smart phone, helping you minimize costly, inconvenient service calls.¹, 
Water Plus: LG top load washers use precise wash motions to ensure clothes move efficiently through the detergent and water mix and come out ultra-clean, all while saving energy and money. But if you decide you want to add extra water to the occasional load, LG gives you the option to get your (deep) fill. Press Water Plus at the start of any cycle to select the maximum water level., 
: Cycle already started? Just hit Pause, Water Plus and then Start. Another plus—the one-time setting will automatically switch back to high-efficiency water levels the next time you’re ready to wash., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub avoids the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing., 
Direct Drive Motor 10-Year Limited Warranty: Backed by a 10-year limited warranty, the LG Direct Drive Motor delivers peace of mind with every load. Fewer moving parts means less noise and vibration, greater stability and durable performance you can depend on for years to come., 
SlamProof Glass Lid: Enjoy the convenience of a clear lid that allows you to watch your washer in action, uninterrupted. And the convenient SlamProof Lid automatically closes and firmly holds itself at certain angles, thanks to our smooth-operating hydraulic hinge., 
True Balance Anti-Vibration System and LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer whenever you want— LG 's True Balance Anti-Vibration and LoDecibel systems are designed for quiet operation that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main-floor or second-floor laundry rooms., 
SpeedWash Cycle: Let's face it: Sometimes, you just don't have time to wait for a standard wash cycle. When you're in a rush, LG's SpeedWash Cycle gets small lightly soiled loads refreshed in just 15 minutes., 
Requires fill hose (not included): for standard hook-up upon delivery.,

Our 6motion technology uses up to 6 different wash motions to provide a smart cleaning experience that is gentle on clothes and maximizes washing performance. The 5.0 cu. ft. capacity on washer means you have even more room to do laundry in fewer loads. And ColdWash technology uses cold water and enhanced washing motions to penetrate deep into fabrics, giving you cold water savings with warm water performance. 
5.0 cu. ft. Mega Capacity: Say never again to never-ending piles of laundry—this mega capacity washer fits more clothes in every load and helps you power through laundry day in less time., 
: With 5.0 cu. ft. mega capacity, you can fit a king-size comforter and more in a single load, for big time savings every week. Get the room and flexibility to clean in fewer loads., 
6Motion Technology: Based on the cycle you select, LG 6Motion technology uses up to 6 different wash motions, each designed to get clothes cleaner and help them last longer. Options range from a scrubbing PowerMotion that helps to dissolve stains to a gentle Swinging motion ideal for delicates., 
ColdWash Technology: Saving energy doesn’t have to mean compromising on cleaning with the ColdWash option. Powered by the LG Direct Drive Motor and 6 motion technology, it’s ideal for cleaning all types of clothes—even those you normally wash in warm water., 
: Can be used with almost any wash cycle and virtually all fabric types., 
Direct Drive Motor 10-Year Limited Warranty: Backed by a 10-year limited warranty, the LG Direct Drive Motor delivers peace of mind with every load. Fewer moving parts means less noise and vibration, greater stability and durable performance you can depend on for years to come., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: This LG high efficiency washer uses far less water and energy than a conventional washer for savings that add up with each load. Get additional savings with load-sensing technology that adjusts water levels and wash times or add the ColdWash option to almost any cycle., 
SideKick Pedestal Washer Compatible: Add the one-of-a-kind LG SideKick pedestal washer¹ and wash small loads that just can’t wait in the compact washer below while you do a big load up top., 
: Warm and cold settings and 6 cycles let you care for all types of items, from delicates and hand washables to workout wear and baby clothes. Elevate your washer for easier loading and unloading., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth² washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in almost any closet with plenty of room to close the closet door., 
: Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer to save even more space., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub avoids the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing., 
True Balance Anti-Vibration System and LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer whenever you want; LG 's True Balance Anti-Vibration and LoDecibel systems are designed for quiet operation to keep even big loads balanced to reduce noise and vibration. A must-have for main or 2nd floor laundry rooms., 
TubClean System: With the LG TubClean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Simply select the TubClean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer do the work to thoroughly clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets., 
: Run it every month or so to help keep your washer—and your laundry—clean and fresh., 
SpeedWash Cycle: Let's face it: Sometimes, you just don't have time to wait for a standard wash cycle. When you're in a rush, LG's SpeedWash Cycle gets small lightly soiled loads refreshed in just 15 minutes., 
Requires fill hose (not included): for standard hook-up upon delivery,

But unlike conventional stacked pairs, LG’s Center Control panel is perfectly positioned with both washer and dryer controls at just the right height. Built-in intelligence makes laundry less of a chore by taking out the guesswork, while top-of-the-line innovations put advanced cleaning power within reach. 
Ultra Large Capacity 4.5 cu.ft. Washer and 7.4 cu.ft. Dryer (WashTower): Get It All Done In Less Time. Ultra Large Capacity (4.5 cu. ft. in the washer and 7.4 cu. ft. in the dryer) means you have even more room to do laundry in fewer loads., 
Single Unit WashTower Design¹: This vertical laundry solution puts everything within reach. Full-size capacity and features in half the space¹, with a centralized control panel for the easiest access ever., 
Built-In Intelligence: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right wash/dry motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care., 
: Activate Smart Learner in the ThinQ app, and WashTower will remember your preferred settings, from wash temp to spin speed to dry level—so you don’t have to. With Smart Pairing, the washer can even tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle, making it the ultimate laundry hack., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
Advanced washing and drying: From ultra-large capacity to high innovations, the LG WashTower delivers the advanced cleaning performance you need. TurboWash 360° powers through larger loads in less time, thanks to five jets with variable sprays that deliver a complete clean in under 30 minutes²., 
: The Allergiene wash cycle goes beyond everyday cleaning, using the power of steam to remove common household allergens such as dust, pet dander and pollen in fabrics by more than 95%.³, 
: Do more than dry—TurboSteam technology in the dryer refreshes clothes in between washes as well as children’s toys, decorative pillows and more., 
AAFA Certified LG Washer: AAFA certified LG washers with the Allergiene Cycle use the power of steam to remove over 95%³ of dust, pet dander and pollen., 
ThinQ Technology with ThinQ Care: The ThinQ App controls laundry remotely and ThinQ Care sends maintenance tips and alerts., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Trim: LG front load washers and dryers are among the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Complementary matte black door trims and nature green finish enhance the premium feel., 
Direct Drive Motor 10-Year Limited Warranty: Backed by a 10-year limited warranty, the LG Direct Drive Motor delivers peace of mind with every load. Fewer moving parts means less noise and vibration, greater stability and durable performance you can depend on for years to come., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: Get additional savings that add up with each load without sacrificing performance., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators tell when your ducts and filter need cleaning of lint buildup, improve dryer performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and give worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike porcelain or plastic tubs, LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tubs avoid the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your washer and dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
TubClean System: With the LG TubClean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Select the TubClean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer work to thoroughly clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets., 
TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System: Noisy, out-of-balance loads can disrupt your laundry routine. LG helps you wash in peace with the TrueBalance anti-vibration system that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main- or second-floor laundry rooms., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer or dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. The LG WashTower is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care option before starting. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
SpeedWash Cycle: Let's face it: Sometimes, you just don't have time to wait for a standard wash cycle. When you're in a rush, LG's SpeedWash Cycle gets small lightly soiled loads refreshed in just 15 minutes.,

TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles and odors in up to 5 garments to refresh clothes in between washes. Built-in intelligence automatically selects the right drying motions, temperatures and more, and even talks to your washer to select a compatible cycle—making it the ultimate laundry hack. You’ll even score high on the durability and style scale, thanks to the scratch-resistant tempered glass door and rose gold accents. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
TurboSteam Technology: Go ahead, wear it again—in just 10 minutes, TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles and odors in up to 5 garments when you don’t have time to wash. Also refreshes children’s toys, decorative pillows and more.,

ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents., 
Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer.: It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home., ","https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6419/6419629_sd.jpg

The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay.,

ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best.,

Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer.: It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home.,

Stackable Smart Electric Dryer with Dual Inverter HeatPump - White,dlhc1455w,$999.99,4.1,271.0,https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6397/6397871_sd.jpg;maxHeight=640;maxWidth=550,"This sleek dryer offers big style and big capacity in a small 24” wide footprint, with a go-anywhere ventless design that can be installed side by side or stacked on top of a compact LG washer. But saving space is just the beginning—LG’s innovative HeatPump technology saves energy with the dryer usage on every load. Unlike conventional condenser ventless dryers that extract the moisture from clothes and pumps it out of the dryer, this dryer extracts the moisture and recycles it for more energy-efficient drying, every day. 
4.2 cu. ft. Compact Capacity: This dryer handles surprisingly big loads for its size while expanding your installation options at the same time. The ventless design means you can put it anywhere, without worrying about long ducting runs, access to exterior walls or maintenance., 
Dual Inverter HeatPump Technology: Meet a more modern approach to drying. LG HeatPump technology extracts moisture from clothes and recycles the warm, humid air., 
Auto Cleaning Condenser: Using water extracted during the drying cycle, it powerfully flushes away lint and debris every time you dry for better airflow, better drying and enhanced energy efficiency—automatically., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
ThinQ Technology with Smart Pairing: Use the ThinQ app to start the laundry while you’re out shopping, check remaining cycle time or get notifications on your smartphone. Go hands-free—select features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
Sensor Dry: No more damp clothes—the built-in sensor detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes. No more overdrying—dryer shuts off at just the right time to save energy with less wear and tear on clothes., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Chrome Trim: LG front load washers and dryers are the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Chrome rims and matching control knobs complement the doors and enhance the premium feel., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub avoids the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your washer/dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door (Dryer): When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer.: It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home., ","https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6397/6397871_sd.jpg

Single Unit WashTower Design¹: This vertical laundry solution puts everything within reach. Full-size capacity and features in half the space¹, with a centralized control panel for the easiest access ever., 
Built-In Intelligence: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right wash/dry motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care., 
: Activate Smart Learner in the ThinQ app, and WashTower will remember your preferred settings, from wash temp to spin speed to dry level—so you don’t have to. With Smart Pairing, the washer can even tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle, making it the ultimate laundry hack., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
Advanced washing and drying: From ultra-large capacity to high innovations, the LG WashTower delivers the advanced cleaning performance you need. TurboWash 360° powers through larger loads in less time, thanks to five jets with variable sprays that deliver a complete clean in under 30 minutes²., 
: The Allergiene wash cycle goes beyond everyday cleaning, using the power of steam to remove common household allergens such as dust, pet dander and pollen in fabrics by more than 95%.³, 
: Do more than dry—TurboSteam technology in the dryer refreshes clothes in between washes as well as children’s toys, decorative pillows and more., 
AAFA Certified LG Washer: AAFA certified LG washers with the Allergiene Cycle use the power of steam to remove over 95%³ of dust, pet dander and pollen., 
ThinQ Technology with ThinQ Care: The ThinQ App controls laundry remotely and ThinQ Care sends maintenance tips and alerts., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Trim: LG front load washers and dryers are among the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Complementary matte black door trims and nature green finish enhance the premium feel., 
Direct Drive Motor 10-Year Limited Warranty: Backed by a 10-year limited warranty, the LG Direct Drive Motor delivers peace of mind with every load. Fewer moving parts means less noise and vibration, greater stability and durable performance you can depend on for years to come., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: Get additional savings that add up with each load without sacrificing performance., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators tell when your ducts and filter need cleaning of lint buildup, improve dryer performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and give worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike porcelain or plastic tubs, LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tubs avoid the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your washer and dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
TubClean System: With the LG TubClean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Select the TubClean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer work to thoroughly clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets., 
TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System: Noisy, out-of-balance loads can disrupt your laundry routine. LG helps you wash in peace with the TrueBalance anti-vibration system that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main- or second-floor laundry rooms., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer or dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. The LG WashTower is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care option before starting. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
SpeedWash Cycle: Let's face it: Sometimes, you just don't have time to wait for a standard wash cycle. When you're in a rush, LG's SpeedWash Cycle gets small lightly soiled loads refreshed in just 15 minutes.,

By smartly recycling the pre-warmed air rather than venting it outside. But savings are only one reason to start drying differently. Ventless design can be installed almost anywhere, with a modern look that elevates any room. Even caring for favorite clothes takes a new turn—our exclusive Direct Drive Motor delivers precise tumbling motions that are perfect for delicates. 
7.8 cu. ft. Mega Capacity: Say never again to never-ending piles of laundry—this mega capacity dryer is among the largest front load ventless heat pump unit in its class² and can easily handle the laundry needs of a family of five. How big is 7.8 cu. ft.? Big enough to fit a king-size comforter and more in a single load for big time savings every week., 
Sleek Ventless Design: Space-saving ventless design means it can be installed virtually anywhere. No detail was overlooked in this dryer's sleek, modern style. The flat front design with a choice of black steel, graphite steel or white finish and tinted, tempered glass door brings a premium point of view to your laundry space., 
LCD Digital Dial Control: Customize your dry—or let AI Dry do it for you. Laundry day is just that easy with LG’s built-in intelligence and intuitive LCD dial. Streamlined controls give you more of what you need with each turn of the dial, from descriptions of each setting and helpful prompts to status updates and remaining cycle time. Easily access more than 20 cycles and quickly modify any cycle using the touch panel for total laundry control., 
Dual Inverter Heat Pump Technology: Meet a more modern approach to drying. LG's DUAL Inverter Heat Pump technology uses up to 65% less energy to dry every load.³ Not only does this ENERGY STAR certified dryer feature LG’s most energy efficient ventless drying system, the low temperatures are easier on clothes and can help them look their best for longer. And with no need for venting, this dryer is easy to install and is virtually maintenance free., 
Inverter Direct Drive Motor System: When it comes to powerful, reliable performance, there’s just no comparison. Featuring LG Exclusive Direct Drive Dryer, this ventless dryer provides even drying performance and precise tumbling motions that are extra kind to delicates. You’ll enjoy quiet operation and greater energy efficiency than belt-driven motors—no belts, no pulleys, no worries. What else can you count on? The peace of mind of a 10-year limited warranty., 
Built-In Intelligence: AI Sensor Dry with Infrared Sensor: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. A combination of AI Sensor Dry plus an additional IR sensor detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes., 
: All to ensure this ventless dryer delivers the LG drying performance you expect—no more damp clothes, no more over-drying., 
ThinQ Smart Technology: The ThinQ app offers control and convenience to help you simplify life and enjoy the comforts of home. Control your dryer remotely or use voice commands with Google or Alexa voice assistants. Plus, download additional cycles and access Smart Diagnosis, customer support, and more.⁴, 
ThinQ UP: ThinQ UP enabled smart appliances receive continual software updates for new downloadable features and enhancements sent wirelessly to the appliance. Choose which features you want and customize your appliance based on your lifestyle and personal preferences., 
ThinQ Care: Available within the ThinQ app, ThinQ Care sends proactive usage, maintenance, and diagnostic alerts to your smartphone to help keep your LG smart appliances running smoothly., 
Auto Cleaning Condenser: Unlike some dryers that require manual cleaning of the condenser for optimal performance, LG’s Auto Cleaning Condenser does the work for you. Using water extracted during the drying cycle, it powerfully flushes away lint and debris every time you dry for better airflow, better drying and enhanced energy efficiency—automatically., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer to save even more space., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub avoids the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
: Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer. It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home.,

TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles in just 10 minutes for those times when there is no time to wash. Built-in intelligence automatically selects the right settings to eliminate the guesswork, and can even talk to your washer to pick a compatible cycle. Smart features fit your life with the ability to start the dryer when you are on the go or send routine maintenance updates to help you protect your investment. All of this convenience with a sleed design and scratch-resistant tempered glass door with chrome accents. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
TurboSteam Technology: Go ahead, wear it again—in just 10 minutes, TurboSteam technology reduces wrinkles and odors in up to 5 garments when you don’t have time to wash. Also refreshes children’s toys, decorative pillows and more., 
Built-In Intelligence: Built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes, 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
ThinQ Technology: No matter where you are, use the ThinQ app to start the dryer, extend cycle time to avoid wrinkles and receive an alert when clothes are dry. Go hands-free—select dryer features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers are the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents*., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators tell when ducts and filter need cleaning of lint buildup, improve dryer performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and give safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., ","https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6419/6419626_sd.jpg

But unlike conventional stacked pairs, LG’s Center Control panel is perfectly positioned with both washer and dryer controls at just the right height. Built-in intelligence makes laundry less of a chore by taking out the guesswork, while top-of-the-line innovations put advanced cleaning power within reach. 
Ultra Large Capacity 4.5 cu.ft. Washer and 7.4 cu.ft. Dryer (WashTower): Get it all done in less time. Ultra Large Capacity (4.5 cu. ft. in the washer and 7.4 cu. ft. in the dryer) means you have even more room to do laundry in fewer loads., 
Single Unit WashTower Design¹: This vertical laundry solution puts everything within reach. Full-size capacity and features in half the space¹, with a centralized control panel for the easiest access ever.,

ThinQ Technology with ThinQ Care: The ThinQ App controls laundry remotely and ThinQ Care sends maintenance tips and alerts., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Trim: LG front load washers and dryers are among the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Complementary matte black door trims and nature green finish enhance the premium feel., 
Direct Drive Motor 10-Year Limited Warranty: Backed by a 10-year limited warranty, the LG Direct Drive Motor delivers peace of mind with every load. Fewer moving parts means less noise and vibration, greater stability and durable performance you can depend on for years to come.,

TubClean System: With the LG TubClean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Select the TubClean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer work to thoroughly clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets., 
TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System: Noisy, out-of-balance loads can disrupt your laundry routine. LG helps you wash in peace with the TrueBalance anti-vibration system that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main- or second-floor laundry rooms., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer or dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. The LG WashTower is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care option before starting. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
SpeedWash Cycle: Let's face it: Sometimes, you just don't have time to wait for a standard wash cycle. When you're in a rush, LG's SpeedWash Cycle gets small lightly soiled loads refreshed in just 15 minutes.,

This dryer takes out the guesswork, with built-in intelligence that uses advanced sensors and AI technology to automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more. It can even talk to your washer to select a compatible cycle—so you don’t have to. What could be easier? Use the ThinQ app to start or stop the dryer from anywhere, and even receive an alert when clothes are dry. Durable and stylish tempered glass door with white or silver accents adds the perfect finish. 
7.4 cu. ft. Ultra Large Capacity: Free up your day—fit more clothes in every load with 7.4 cu. ft. of space. Running fewer loads saves energy and money on your utility bill., 
Built-In Intelligence: Built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right drying motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. Sensor Dry detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes, 
ThinQ Technology: No matter where you are, use the ThinQ app to start the dryer, extend cycle time to avoid wrinkles and receive an alert when clothes are dry. Go hands-free—select dryer features work with Alexa and the Google Assistant., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
Tempered Glass Door: LG front load washers and dryers use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. The premium feel is further enhanced by matching door trim and control knob accents., 
FlowSense: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators let you know when your ducts and filter need cleaning to avoid lint buildup, improve the dryer’s performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and help give you safer, worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: High efficiency sensor drying and low-heat settings save energy and money by using about 20% less energy than conventional models without sacrificing features or performance., 
Closet Depth: LG closet-depth washers and dryers are worth showing off, but when space dictates otherwise it’s good to know they’ll easily fit in a closet with plenty of room to close the closet door. Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer., 
Aluminized Alloy Steel Drum: An advanced aluminized alloy coating is added to the steel dryer drum to enhance durability and maintain its luster and attractive finish. Helps keep nicks and chips at bay so your dryer looks like new even after years of use., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible Door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer.: It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home., ","https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6419/6419630_sd.jpg

Install the pair side-by-side, or get a stacking kit and install the dryer over the washer to save even more space., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum: Just because you want your dryer to last for years doesn’t mean you want it to look its age. The NeveRust Stainless Steel Drum is built to keep drying your clothes more efficiently without showing wear and tear., 
LoDecibel quiet operation: Run the dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. This dryer is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components. Pleasant end-of-cycle chime lets you know when clothes are dry., 
Reversible door: When space is tight or your laundry room doesn’t fit the “typical” setup, this dryer’s door can easily be reversed to fit your needs. Go from a right swing to a left swing in minutes—just unscrew the hinges and reattach using the pre-drilled holes on the opposite side., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care option before starting. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
: Dryer cords are not shipped with the dryer. It is the responsibility of the consumer to purchase the appropriate cord for their home., 
: ¹Refresh in just 10 minutes up to 5 garments, based on test conducted at LG’s test lab facility in December, 2014.,

Capacity, Butterfly Drying System, Soft Drum Technology, 9 Drying Programs, Anti-Crease Mode, and Delay Start 
Soft Drum: Soft Drum is a solution developed to enhance air flow around the load, thereby increasing the drying effect. The circular indentations with bevelled edges also have a cushioning effect that reduces wear and tear on fabrics. The new drum design allows for even and gentle drying with both small and large loads., 
Butterfly Drying: This smart feature is our own invention. It saves both the motor and your ironing board. The unique paddles inside the drum tumble the clothes in a figure eight to prevent the clothes from bundling. This leads to a reduced need to reverse the drum rotation. This is an intelligent function which saves the motor and the belt from any unnecessary strain and your clothes from creasing., 
Multi Filter System: The Multi Filter System effectively traps all lint before reaching more sensitive parts of the tumble dryer. This keeps the drying times shorter and the machine up and running., 
Sensi dry: The ASKO Sensi Dry system measures moisture in and around the machine, which prevents unnecessary over-drying as well as wear and tear on your clothes., 
Stainless Steel Drum: At ASKO, we believe not only that stainless steel will outlast for example, plastic, but also that quality materials will always look better in years to come. Eventually, galvanised steel rusts, so we decided to make our drums out of stainless steel. That’s why our tumble dryers really do last longer., ",,,33.5,23.5,23.5,,4.1,No,Electric,Yes,,W2084W,Yes,450808,No,,,"Asko 4.1 cu. ft.

Soft Drum: Soft Drum is a solution developed to enhance air flow around the load, thereby increasing the drying effect. The circular indentations with bevelled edges also have a cushioning effect that reduces wear and tear on fabrics. The new drum design allows for even and gentle drying with both small and large loads., 
Butterfly Drying: This smart feature is our own invention. It saves both the motor and your ironing board. The unique paddles inside the drum tumble the clothes in a figure eight to prevent the clothes from bundling. This leads to a reduced need to reverse the drum rotation. This is an intelligent function which saves the motor and the belt from any unnecessary strain and your clothes from creasing., 
Multi Filter System: The Multi Filter System effectively traps all lint before reaching more sensitive parts of the tumble dryer. This keeps the drying times shorter and the machine up and running., 
Sensi dry: The ASKO Sensi Dry system measures moisture in and around the machine, which prevents unnecessary over-drying as well as wear and tear on your clothes., 
Stainless Steel Drum: At ASKO, we believe not only that stainless steel will outlast for example, plastic, but also that quality materials will always look better in years to come.

But unlike conventional stacked pairs, LG’s exclusive Center Control panel is perfectly positioned with both washer and dryer controls at just the right height. The intuitive Center Control LCD panel gives you more of what you need with every touch, from descriptions of each setting and helpful prompts to status updates and remaining cycle time. Built-in intelligence makes laundry less of a chore by taking out the guesswork, while top-of-the-line innovations put advanced cleaning power within reach.

ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best.,

: Activate Smart Learner² in the ThinQ app, and WashTower will remember your preferred settings, from wash temp to spin speed to dry level—so you don’t have to. With Smart Pairing, the washer can even tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle³, making it the ultimate laundry hack., 
Advanced Washing and Drying: From mega capacity to top-of-the-line innovations, the LG WashTower delivers the advanced cleaning performance you need., 
ezDispense Automatic Dispenser: Automatically dispenses the right amount of detergent and fabric softener, skipping refills for up to 18 loads⁴. Even get alerts on your smartphone when it’s time to refill, making laundry quick, easy and foolproof.⁵,

Tub Clean System: With LG Tub Clean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Select the Tub Clean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer work to clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets. Run it every month or so to keep your washer clean and fresh., 
TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System: Noisy, out-of-balance loads can disrupt your laundry routine. LG helps you wash in peace with the TrueBalance anti-vibration system that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main- or second-floor laundry rooms., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer or dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. The LG WashTower is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay.,

Built from heavy, galvanized steel and a porcelain enamel top, the cabinet has been designed to increase machine longevity and handle regular use. The powerful drive system was engineered and tested to provide more turns over the life of the washer and provide customers with an exceptional cleaning experience. A six-point suspension with four dampers and two springs delivers automatic load balancing, keeping cycle times consistent to help optimize laundry efficiency. Owners can take advantage of the microprocessor controls with customizable vend prices and cycle options, giving them more opportunities to generate revenue. This also lets customers choose which cycle selection best fits their washing needs. Plus, the advanced dryer venting system delivers an optimal drying performance, helping laundry facilities cut utility costs and run with efficiency. The Whirlpool Commercial Laundry stack washer/dryer is coin drop-ready, ENERGY STAR certified, and backed by a 90-day labor/2-year limited parts only warranty.

Automatic load balancing system: Consists of a six-point suspension, four dampers, and two springs. By sensing and automatically balancing a load, the machines are able to work effectively and end on time, creating optimized cleaning cycles and constant turns., 
Microprocessor controls: Offer owners the ability to customize vend prices and washer cycle options, such as Super Cycle, ensuring optimal revenue opportunities. The controls also give customers the option to select the ideal cycle for individual wash needs.,

Super Cycle: Offers an extra three minutes of wash time or an additional rinse for an additional cost to the user, boosting revenue opportunities., 
Time-of-day pricing: The controls offer the flexibility to program different vend pricing based on the day of the week and time of day. This allows owners to take full advantage of revenue-generating opportunities for their operation., 
High-efficiency wash system: The high-efficiency technology delivers energy savings without sacrificing cleaning performance. Water is lifted from the tub base through baffle holes, then showered through the load during the agitation pattern., 
Shaft sleeve: Helps eliminate drive shaft wear. The robust axial compression tube locks the two inner races of the premium NSK bearings, ensuring they turn with the shaft, helping to prevent drive shaft wear.,

Pump routine: Reduces unbalanced loads through improved pump performance., 
Strategically designed bellow: Helps keep small items from getting caught or snagged, ensuring all items get an equal clean.,

Equipped with a HeatPump ventless dryer, it offers flexible installation and greater energy savings—using up to 65% less energy to dry every load¹. What didn’t change? The single unit design still takes up half the space². Washer and dryer controls are still at just the right height on the Center Control panel. And it still takes out the guesswork with built-in intelligence while delivering advanced cleaning power. 
Convenient Capacity, Compact Design: At just 24” wide, LG delivers towering convenience and advanced cleaning to even the smallest of spaces. Built on the same single unit platform with the washer on the bottom and the dryer on top, just in a narrower width. Despite its compact size, you’ll have plenty of room to handle hefty loads, with 2.4 cu. ft. capacity in the washer and 4.2 in the dryer., 
Single Unit WashTower Design: Redefine your space and reinvent how you do laundry with room to add a sink, a folding table or just organized storage—all with a sleek, streamlined look. Only LG WashTower has the convenient Center Control panel that’s perfectly positioned with both washer and dryer controls at just the right height., 
: Typical stacked washers and dryers place dryer controls at the very top, making them hard to see and reach without using a step stool every time. The ventless design on the dryer offers greater flexibility for more installation options., 
Dual Inverter HeatPump Technology: Meet a more modern approach to drying. LG's Dual Inverter HeatPump technology uses up to 65% less energy to dry every load.¹ Not only does this ENERGY STAR certified dryer feature LG’s most energy efficient ventless drying system, the low temperatures are easier on clothes and can help them look their best for longer. And with no need for venting, this dryer is easy to install and is virtually maintenance free., 
Inverter Direct Drive Motor System: When it comes to powerful, reliable performance, there’s just no comparison. Featuring LG exclusive Direct Drive Motor System, this ventless vertical laundry solution provides even washing performance and precise tumbling motions that are extra kind to delicates. You’ll enjoy quiet operation and greater energy efficiency than belt-driven motors—no belts, no pulleys, no worries. What else can you count on? The peace of mind of a 10-year limited warranty., 
Built-In Intelligence: AI Wash Sensor / Smart Pairing: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right wash motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care. With Smart Pairing, the washer can even tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle³, making it the ultimate laundry hack., 
Sensor Dry: No more damp clothes—the built-in sensor detects moisture levels and automatically adjusts drying time for loads of all sizes. No more overdrying—dryer shuts off at just the right time to save energy with less wear and tear on clothes., 
Advanced Washing: TurboWash 360° and Allergiene Wash Cycle: With top-of-the-line innovations, this LG WashTower delivers the advanced cleaning performance you need. TurboWash 360° powers through laundry, thanks to four jets with variable sprays that deliver a complete clean. The Allergiene wash cycle goes beyond everyday cleaning, using the power of steam to remove common household allergens such as dust mites, pet dander in fabrics by more than 90%⁴., 
Auto Cleaning Condenser: Unlike some dryers that require manual cleaning of the condenser for optimal performance, LG’s Auto Cleaning Condenser does the work for you. Using water extracted during the drying cycle, it powerfully flushes away lint and debris every time you dry for better airflow, better drying and enhanced energy efficiency—automatically., 
ThinQ Smart Technology: The ThinQ app offers control and convenience to help you simplify life and enjoy the comforts of home. Control your washer/dryer combo remotely or use voice commands with Google or Alexa voice assistants. Plus, download additional cycles and access Smart Diagnosis, customer support, and more., 
ThinQ UP: ThinQ UP enabled smart appliances receive continual software updates for new downloadable features and enhancements sent wirelessly to the appliance. Choose which features you want and customize your appliance based on your lifestyle and personal preferences., 
ThinQ Care: Available within the ThinQ app, ThinQ Care sends proactive usage, maintenance, and diagnostic alerts to your smartphone to help keep your LG smart appliances running smoothly., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Matte Black Rim: LG WashTower uses tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Matte black rim complements the doors and enhances the premium feel., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tubs: Unlike tubs made from porcelain or plastic, the LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tubs avoid the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your washer and dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
Tub Clean System: With the LG Tub Clean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Simply select the Tub Clean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer do the work to thoroughly clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets. Run it every month or so to keep your washer—and your laundry—clean and fresh., 
TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System: Noisy, out-of-balance loads can disrupt your laundry routine—and your day. LG helps you wash in peace with the TrueBalance anti-vibration system that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main-floor or second-floor laundry rooms., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer or dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. The LG WashTower is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, just select the Wrinkle Care option before hitting start. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay.,

Electric Dryer WashTower with Steam and Built-In Intelligence - Black Steel,wkex200hba,"$1,899.99",4.7,1426.0,https://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/6420/6420312_sd.jpg;maxHeight=640;maxWidth=550,"Full-size and fully featured, with the washer on the bottom and dryer on top, the sleek single unit LG WashTower takes up half the space, giving you room to add a sink, a folding table or whatever you like. But unlike conventional stacked pairs, LG’s Center Control panel is perfectly positioned with both washer and dryer controls at just the right height. Built-in intelligence makes laundry less of a chore by taking out the guesswork, while top-of-the-line innovations put advanced cleaning power within reach. 
Ultra Large Capacity 4.5 cu.ft. Washer and 7.4 cu.ft. Dryer (WashTower): Get It All Done In Less Time. Ultra Large Capacity (4.5 cu. ft. in the washer and 7.4 cu. ft. in the dryer) means you have even more room to do laundry in fewer loads., 
Single Unit WashTower Design¹: This vertical laundry solution puts everything within reach. Full-size capacity and features in half the space¹, with a centralized control panel for the easiest access ever., 
Built-In Intelligence: Forget about endless sorting or toggling through cycles—built-in sensors use AI technology to detect fabric texture and load size, then automatically select the right wash/dry motions, temperatures and more for advanced fabric care., 
: Activate Smart Learner in the ThinQ app, and WashTower will remember your preferred settings, from wash temp to spin speed to dry level—so you don’t have to. With Smart Pairing, the washer can even tell the dryer to select a compatible drying cycle, making it the ultimate laundry hack., 
ThinQ Care: Keep your appliances running smoothly with ThinQ Care, now in the ThinQ app. Get notifications about usage, maintenance, plus early diagnosis right on your phone. ThinQ Care will help you understand your appliance needs, avoid potential problems, and keep your appliance running its best., 
Advanced washing and drying: From ultra-large capacity to high innovations, the LG WashTower delivers the advanced cleaning performance you need. TurboWash 360° powers through larger loads in less time, thanks to five jets with variable sprays that deliver a complete clean in under 30 minutes²., 
: The Allergiene wash cycle goes beyond everyday cleaning, using the power of steam to remove common household allergens such as dust, pet dander and pollen in fabrics by more than 95%.³, 
: Do more than dry—TurboSteam technology in the dryer refreshes clothes in between washes as well as children’s toys, decorative pillows and more., 
AAFA Certified LG Washer: AAFA certified LG washers with the Allergiene Cycle use the power of steam to remove over 95%³ of dust, pet dander and pollen., 
ThinQ Technology with ThinQ Care: The ThinQ App controls laundry remotely and ThinQ Care sends maintenance tips and alerts., 
Tempered Glass Doors with Trim: LG front load washers and dryers are among the first to use tempered glass doors for a sleek, stylish look that resists shock and scratches. Complementary matte black door trims and nature green finish enhance the premium feel., 
Direct Drive Motor 10-Year Limited Warranty: Backed by a 10-year limited warranty, the LG Direct Drive Motor delivers peace of mind with every load. Fewer moving parts means less noise and vibration, greater stability and durable performance you can depend on for years to come., 
ENERGY STAR Certified: Get additional savings that add up with each load without sacrificing performance., 
FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators: FlowSense Duct Clogging and Lint Filter Indicators tell when your ducts and filter need cleaning of lint buildup, improve dryer performance for greater efficiency and lower utility bills, and give worry-free operation with fewer service calls., 
NeveRust Stainless Steel Tub: Unlike porcelain or plastic tubs, LG NeveRust Stainless Steel Tubs avoid the chips and nicks that can snag fabrics and ruin clothing. Durable surface actually gets smoother over time and keeps your washer and dryer looking like new, even after years of use., 
TubClean System: With the LG TubClean system, you don’t have to worry about mold, mildew or musty odors. Select the TubClean cycle, add liquid bleach or other cleaner and let the washer work to thoroughly clean and dry the tub, door and gaskets., 
TrueBalance Anti-Vibration System: Noisy, out-of-balance loads can disrupt your laundry routine. LG helps you wash in peace with the TrueBalance anti-vibration system that keeps even big loads in balance to reduce washer noise and vibration. A must-have for main- or second-floor laundry rooms., 
LoDecibel Quiet Operation: Run the washer or dryer whenever you want, without interrupting naptime or your favorite show. The LG WashTower is designed for quiet operation, from the motor to the cabinet to individual components., 
Wrinkle Care Option: When you hate wrinkles but can’t be there to remove clothes as soon as they’re dry, select the Wrinkle Care option before starting. The dryer will periodically tumble the load for up to 3 hours after the cycle is done or until the door is opened to help keep wrinkles at bay., 
SpeedWash Cycle: Let's face it: Sometimes, you just don't have time to wait for a standard wash cycle. When you're in a rush, LG's SpeedWash Cycle gets small lightly soiled loads refreshed in just 15 minutes.,
